-- wands distinct by id, code, power => coins_needed 
-- wands_property distinct by code => age, is_evil 



-- METHOD 1: USE WHERE = SUB QUERY  

-- find the min(coins_needed) for any given code(age) and power
-- merge in age in place of code, subset to non-evil 
-- use where clause to subset wands to limit to IDs with min coins
-- order by power desc, age desc

select distinct A.ID, B.age, A.coins_needed, A.power 
from wands A 
inner join wands_property B 
on A.code = B.code and B.is_evil <> 1 
where A.coins_needed = (select min(c.coins_needed) from wands c 
                       where A.code = c.code and A.power = c.power) 
order by A.power desc, B.age desc; 




-- METHOD 2: INNER JOIN TO SUBSET

-- find the min coins for each age(code) and power where non-evil 
-- merge in ID by equating code, power and coins_needed 
-- order by power desc, age desc 

select distinct W.ID, C.age , C.coins_needed, C.power 
from wands W 
inner join 
(select distinct B.age, A.power, A.code, min(A.coins_needed) as coins_needed
from wands A inner join wands_property B on a.code = B.code where B.is_evil != 1 
 group by B.age, A.power, A.code) C 
on W.coins_needed = C.coins_needed and W.power = C.power and W.code = C.code
order by C.power desc, C.age desc;
