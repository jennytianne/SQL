-- inner join is very important, cannot use left join. Because here we're counting everything from A
-- group by, having, order by can all just use number reference or plain/renamed variable name without table reference
-- can directly have count() in having and not in select, because select comes last from the combined table

select A.hacker_id,  D.name 
from submissions A 
inner join challenges B
on A.challenge_id = B.challenge_id 
inner join difficulty C 
on B.difficulty_level = C.difficulty_level and A.score = C.score
inner join hackers D 
on A.hacker_id = D.hacker_id 
group by hacker_id, name
having count(A.challenge_id)  > 1 
order by count(A.challenge_id) desc , hacker_id;
